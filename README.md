# Membrano
## A simple protector for your Stethoscope.
In our recent extensive market survey[^1] 63% of all medical professionals[^1] stated they carry their stethoscope in their pocket,
although lot of them said they're not happy whith this solution, as coins, pens and other objects can easily damage the membranes of the stethoscope
and retriving it can be cumbersome.

<br>
To solve this crisis our engineering team[^2] worked tirelessly to create a simple, 3D-printable pocket organizer and protector for one of the most popular stethoscopes,
the Littmann Classic III. If you'd like a similar protector for your favourite model, just send me the measurements and i'll update the CAD-file and share it here.
